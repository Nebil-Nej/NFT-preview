### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

what i learned is how to activate the action states, the hover keyterm in CSS and the use of border radius mostof all, as i forgot them at a time and was reminded by other ways.

### Continued development

i want to focus more on CSS and know some of the HTML tags more so they can come to me easily and i can use them easily.
